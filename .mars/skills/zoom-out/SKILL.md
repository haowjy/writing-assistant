# Zoom Out

Load `/qi-layer` if it isn't already loaded.

Orient in an unfamiliar area by fanning out parallel explorers, each covering a different angle, then synthesizing their reports into one orientation map. A single explorer sees one slice; zoom-out covers code *and* knowledge *and* history at once, so the picture isn't skewed by one lens.

Use when starting in an unfamiliar subsystem, picking up someone else's work, or when the user says "orient me" / "what's the lay of the land here."

## Fan Out

Spawn in parallel, each scoped to one angle and one question. Drain with `meridian spawn wait`.

- **Code structure** (`@explorer`): callers, dependencies, module boundaries, entry points, where behavior actually lives.
- **Documented knowledge** (`@explorer` over the KB, `meridian context kb`): what's been written about this area, including architecture, guides, synthesized research.
- **Decision history** (`@session-miner`): why it's shaped this way. Prior choices, rejected alternatives, constraints discovered. Skip when there's no relevant session history.
- **Domain concepts** (`@explorer`): the vocabulary in use (KB vocab pages, `.context/CONTEXT.md`, AGENTS.md).

Scope each prompt to its angle with concrete path or topic targets. Don't let one explorer cover two angles: the value is independent coverage.

## Synthesize

Read the reports and produce one orientation map, not four stitched-together dumps:

- **What this is**: the area's purpose and boundaries, in two or three sentences.
- **Structure**: the modules and interfaces that matter and how they connect (a mermaid diagram if the shape is spatial).
- **Why it's like this**: the decisions and constraints that explain the current shape.
- **Vocabulary**: the terms needed to speak about it precisely.
- **Open threads**: gaps, debt, or unresolved questions the explorers surfaced.

When reports contradict each other, resolve it rather than listing both: code is ground truth; a doc that disagrees is stale (note it). Keep the map tight: the goal is a reader who can now navigate the area, not an exhaustive transcript.
