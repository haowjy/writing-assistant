# Pre-Dev Checkpoint

Run this before handing off to an implementation agent. Verify the workspace
is ready for code changes.

## Checks

### Worktree isolation
Should this work be on a worktree? Prefer worktrees for:
- Any feature branch work
- Risky or experimental changes  
- Parallel work alongside other agents
- Changes spanning multiple files or subsystems

If not already in a worktree, create one:
```bash
git -C <repo> worktree add ../<repo>.worktrees/<slug> -b <branch>
meridian work task-dir ../<repo>.worktrees/<slug>
```

### PR body draft
Copy the repo's PR template into the work dir now, before any code changes
land, if `pr-body-<slug>.md` doesn't already exist there — whether or not
the worktree itself was newly created this pass:

```bash
cp <repo>/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md \
   "$MERIDIAN_ACTIVE_WORK_DIR/pr-body-<slug>.md"
```

Use the nearest match if that exact path doesn't exist
(`.github/pull_request_template.md`, repo root, `docs/`); if the repo has no
template, start the draft blank instead of skipping the step.

This draft is the acceptance frame the implementation handoff targets —
sections fill in as work proceeds — and it's the only path by which the
template reaches an agent-created PR: the `gh` CLI's template prompting
doesn't apply once `--body-file` is passed, so nothing else populates the
body.

Capture before-state evidence into the draft now, while it still exists —
screenshots of the current rendering for user-facing work, current outputs,
failure text, timings. Delegate the capture (e.g. to a browser/probe agent)
if you can't take it yourself, but don't defer the capture itself: once the
change lands, "before" costs a stack swap and a reconstructed fixture to
recover.

### Branch readiness
- Feature branch exists and is tracking remote
- Branch is up to date with main (or rebased)
- No stale worktrees from prior work on this branch

### Workspace state
- Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes from other work)
- If other agents' uncommitted work is present, stop and report: do not
  proceed over someone else's changes

### Cross-repo awareness
- Does this work span multiple repos? If so, set up task-dirs for each.
- Are there dependency ordering constraints?

## After checks pass

Report readiness. The handoff can proceed.
