# Test Quality Review

Evaluate whether tests earn their maintenance cost. The test writer already
believes their tests are useful: your value comes from finding the ones that
aren't.

## Are They Testing the Right Things?

**Edge cases over happy paths.** The happy path usually works: that's what
the coder verified during implementation. Tests earn their place by catching
what's hard to see: boundary conditions, off-by-one errors, empty inputs,
overflow, unexpected types, partial failure, ordering assumptions.

A test suite that is all happy-path verification gives false confidence.
Count the ratio: if most tests exercise the obvious success case, flag
the gap.

**Behavior over implementation.** Tests that assert on return values, state
changes, and observable side effects survive refactoring. Tests that reach
into private state, assert mock call counts, or mirror the implementation
line-by-line break on every structural change. If a correct refactor would
break the test, it's testing the wrong thing.

**Risk-proportionate coverage.** High-risk paths (data integrity, auth,
integration boundaries, state machines) deserve exhaustive edge cases.
Low-risk paths (formatting, simple getters) deserve nothing or a manual smoke
check. Flag over-testing of low-risk code and under-testing of high-risk code.

## Would They Catch a Real Bug?

**Tautological assertions.** Tests that pass regardless of whether the code
is correct: asserting a mock returns what it was configured to return,
asserting that a function "returned something," or mirroring the
implementation verbatim. Delete the code under test mentally: would this test
still pass?

**Tests that never fail meaningfully.** Assertions that only check "no
exception was thrown" or "function was called." These pass on both correct and
broken code.

**Mock-dominated tests.** When mock setup is longer than the test itself, the
test is verifying the mocks, not the code. If the real collaborator changes
behavior, the mock still passes and the test lies. Flag for refactoring
(extract pure logic) or tier promotion (move to integration).

## Structural Health

**Tier placement.** Is this test at the right level? Unit tests that need
filesystem setup are integration tests in disguise. Integration tests that
spin up real databases are manual smoke checks or automated e2e tests, not
ordinary integration tests. Manual smoke checks that verify string formatting
should usually become unit tests or be dropped.

**Hermetic isolation.** Tests that share state, depend on execution order,
or call real network endpoints are flaky by design. Each test should be
self-contained.

**Readability.** Can you understand what broke from the test name and failure
output alone? `test_returns_empty_list_when_no_matches` beats `test_edge_case_3`.

**Stale tests.** Tests for code paths that no longer exist, behaviors no
longer required, or edge cases superseded by structural changes. They pass,
they cost maintenance, they protect nothing.

## Report Format

For each finding: what test, what's wrong, why it matters, what to do about
it. Group by severity: tests that give false confidence are more dangerous
than tests that are merely wasteful.
