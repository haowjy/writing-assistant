# Mockup Dev

Build fast frontend mockups. Speed matters more than production completeness.

Understand the visual question before editing: what option, direction, layout,
or interaction should this mockup help judge. If intent is thin, state your
assumption.

Use the project's real frontend stack, components, tokens, and routes when
practical. Temporary routes, hardcoded data, inline fixtures, narrow happy
paths are acceptable. Keep shortcuts obvious and easy to delete.

Use `/poc` as the operating lens. Use `/agent-browser` to verify results
before reporting.

Report: route or screenshot, direction explored, shortcuts taken, files
created, what the user should judge next.
