# Privilege Escalation

Meridian agents run with constrained permissions by default: sandboxed filesystems, restricted tools, harness-specific limitations. When a spawn can't complete its task because of these constraints, you can escalate permissions per-spawn without changing the agent profile.

## Escalation Discipline

Prefer the least-privilege escalation that unblocks the task. Try targeted fixes first (`--approval auto`) before broad overrides (`--approval yolo`, `--sandbox danger-full-access`). Broad overrides disable safety checks entirely: if you're reaching for `yolo` or `danger-full-access`, surface the situation to the user first and let them approve the escalation. An autonomous agent silently granting itself maximum permissions defeats the purpose of having tiers.

## Sandbox Tiers (Codex only)

The `--sandbox` flag controls Codex's process sandboxing: filesystem, network, and process isolation. Other harnesses have different escalation paths: Claude supports approval escalation (`--approval`) but not sandbox tier changes. OpenCode permissions vary by configuration. See Approval Modes and Model/Harness Switching below.

Tiers from most to least restrictive:

| Tier | What it allows |
|---|---|
| `read-only` | Read files only. No writes, no process execution. |
| `workspace-write` | Read/write within the workspace. No network listeners, no access outside project. |
| `danger-full-access` | Full filesystem and process access with reduced safety checks. |

Override per-spawn:
```bash
meridian spawn -a coder --sandbox danger-full-access --prompt-file integration-tests.md --bg
```

Agent profiles set a default tier (e.g. `sandbox: workspace-write`). The `--sandbox` flag overrides it for that specific spawn only. The tier passes through directly to Codex's `--sandbox` flag.

## Approval Modes

The `--approval` flag controls how the harness handles tool-call approvals:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `default` | Harness decides (each harness has its own default policy). |
| `confirm` | User approves each tool call. |
| `auto` | Auto-approve safe operations, prompt for dangerous ones. |
| `yolo` | Approve everything. No prompts. |

Override per-spawn:
```bash
meridian spawn -a coder --approval auto --prompt-file task.md --bg
meridian spawn -a coder --approval yolo --prompt-file task.md --bg   # use yolo sparingly
```

## Model/Harness Switching

Different models route to different harnesses, and each harness has different capability profiles. Switching the model can bypass harness-level restrictions entirely:

```bash
# Choose an alias from `meridian mars models list`; use `--live` when you need
# to confirm the needed harness is runnable on this machine.
# Some harnesses have sandboxes that restrict network binding;
# switching to a harness without sandbox restrictions sidesteps the issue.
meridian spawn -a coder -m MODEL_ALIAS --prompt-file task.md --bg
```

Run `meridian mars models list` to see catalog aliases and static routing hints.
Run `meridian mars models list --live` before switching models specifically to
escape a local harness restriction.

## Common Escalation Scenarios

**"Can't bind to a port / start a server"**
On Codex: sandbox restricts network listeners → `--sandbox danger-full-access`.
On Claude: not sandbox-restricted → check if the tool is in the allowedTools list, or use `--approval auto`.

**"Can't write files outside workspace"**
On Codex: sandbox restricts filesystem scope → `--sandbox danger-full-access` for that spawn.
On Claude: escalate to the user: they can approve `--approval yolo` for that spawn.

**"Can't access the network / fetch URLs"**
On Codex: sandbox or tool restriction → ensure WebFetch/WebSearch are in the agent's tools list, or escalate sandbox.
On Claude: ensure the agent profile includes WebFetch/WebSearch tools.

**"Permission denied on tool call"**: approval mode is blocking.
→ `--approval auto` first. If that's not enough, surface to the user before using `--approval yolo`.

**"Context too small for the task"**: model limitation.
→ Switch to a model with a larger context window via `-m`.
