# Browser

Use `/agent-browser` for the full command reference. Core loop:

```bash
agent-browser open https://example.com
agent-browser snapshot -i        # interactive elements, with @eN refs
agent-browser get text @e5
agent-browser screenshot capture.png
```

Refs (`@e1`, `@e2`, …) are reassigned on every snapshot and go stale on any
page change; re-snapshot before each ref interaction.

When someone should watch the session live, `agent-browser dashboard start`
serves a live viewport on `:4848` (expose it via `tailscale serve 4848` to
view from another device).

Use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` when you need documentation or context that
doesn't require a live browser.

Write output to the work directory.
Your final message: what you did, what you found, and where the artifacts are.
